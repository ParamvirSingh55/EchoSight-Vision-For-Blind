# EchoSight-Vision-For-Blind


This project endeavors to create a sophisticated assistive device catering specifically to the needs of
visually impaired individuals, leveraging the capabilities of IoT technology. The core innovation lies
in the integration of ultrasonic sensors into the design of a traditional blind stick, enabling it to detect
obstacles in the user's path. This obstacle detection functionality is crucial for ensuring the user's
safety and promoting independent mobility. Additionally, the inclusion of an ultrasonic soil moisture
sensor adds a novel dimension to the device, allowing users to access real-time information about
soil moisture levels in their surroundings. By utilizing a NodeMCU ESP32 microcontroller as the
central processing unit, the system can efficiently process sensor data and provide timely feedback to
the user. This feedback may take various forms, such as auditory cues, vibration patterns, or tactile
signals, tailored to the user's preferences and accessibility needs. Throughout the development
process, extensive user testing and feedback collection from visually impaired individuals guide the
refinement of the device, ensuring its usability and effectiveness in diverse environments and
scenarios. Ultimately, this innovative solution aims to empower visually impaired users by
enhancing their mobility, promoting environmental awareness, and fostering greater independence in
their daily lives.
